# How to Setup Clearly for the Certification

All files to setup the certif zone simply for students.

How to process ?

Just Copy / Paste this command in your terminal.
This will create a virtual environment with the right version of python and the right versions of the packages you need.
The environment will be created at the following path : ~/code/certification


```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JynxZz/certif_setup/main/setup_certif.sh | zsh
cd ~/code/certification
pwd
```

Good Luck !!
